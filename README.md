A collaborative effort between Inbar, Lindsay, AJ, and Whitney to create an app that allows users to browse & submit reviews on Books & Movies. 

# As a consumer:
I want to visit one great resource to feel empowered about what I will spend my time reading or watching. 

# As developers: 
We used a combination of outside API, original thought, and technologies used: 
*JavaScript
*Pug
*CSS
*Package.json
*Materialize
*MySQL Database
*MVC file structure
*Node
